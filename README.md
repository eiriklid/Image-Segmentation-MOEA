Sufficient to get full score for segmentations.  


TODO:
- [x] FÃ¥ tak i RGB for pixel
- [x] RGB-Distanse mellom piksler
- [x] Putte pixel i segment-set(Lage genotype)
- [x] Fitness for segment
	- [x] Find centroid(average)
	- [x] Find border-pixels
	- [x] For pixel find neighbour pixels
		- [x] dynamic? vector!
		- [x] make 4 & 8(n-boxses) neighbourhood
